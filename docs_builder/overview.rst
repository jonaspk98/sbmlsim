Overview
========
**Mission**: make SBML simulations simple

The idea of sbmlsim is to provide a simple abstraction layer for running
simulations with SBML models in python and simplify common tasks occuring in 
modeling.

**Simplicity**

- make it easy to encode simulation experiments with a focus
    on numerical ODE simulations 

**Simulation**

- timecourse simulations
- combined simulation experiments (combination of changes)
- parameter scans
- parameter sensitivity analysis

**Reproducibility**

- A simplified exchange language based on JSON is part of `sbmlsim`
- COMBINE standards are used whenever possible. 

**Visualization**

- plots and reports

**Parallelization**

-  simple parallelization of multiple simulation, collection of results

**Parameter fitting**
- helpers for running parameter fitting experiments

**Unit support**
- full support for units on model simulations
