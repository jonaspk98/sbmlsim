# Serialization
- [ ] writing SED-ML from experiments

# Plotting
- [ ] support height and width;
      plots have height & width; these can be directly set in single plot figures;
      for multi-plot figures the combined height and width must be calculated
## Plot2D
- [x] use curve.name as label in legend
- [x] support style on axis
- [~] support setting label (name of axis), see https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/issues/110
- [x] plot width and height  
- [x] curve type (points, bar, ...)
  - [ ] fix stacking position
  - [ ] bars next to each other;  
- [ ] error bars
- [ ] yAxis  
- [ ] shaded areas & fills
- [ ] order of abstract curve

# Reports
- [ ] reports
# Repeated Tasks
- [ ] repeated task

## Plot3D
- [ ] Plot3D examples (surfaces)
- [ ] use surface.name as label in legend

# Simulation
- [ ] steady state & one-step

# Parameter fitting
