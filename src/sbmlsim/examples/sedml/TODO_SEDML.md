# Serialization
- [ ] writing SED-ML from experiments (Combine archive)

# Run Co

# Plotting
- [x] support height and width;
      plots have height & width; these can be directly set in single plot figures;
      for multi-plot figures the combined height and width must be calculated
## Plot2D
- [x] use curve.name as label in legend
- [x] support style on axis
- [~] support setting label (name of axis), see https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/issues/110
- [x] plot width and height  
- [x] curve type (points, bar, ...)
  - [x] fix stacking position
  - [~] bars next to each other; see https://github.com/SED-ML/sed-ml/issues/138  
- [~] error bars; see https://github.com/SED-ML/sed-ml/issues/137
- [x] styling of bar plots; 
- [x] yAxis right  

- [x] order of abstract curve
- [x] shaded areas & fills
- [ ] resolve and apply basestyle

# Reports

## Plot3D
- [ ] Plot3D examples (surfaces)
- [ ] use surface.name as label in legend

# Simulation
- [ ] steady state & one-step
