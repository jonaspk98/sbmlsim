    model, when used within a target attribute, a single element or attribute must be selected by the
    expression.
    The target attribute may also be used in three situations to reference another SED-ML element with
    mathematical meaning, by containing a fragment identifier consisting of a hash character (#) followed
    by the SId of the element (i.e. “#id001”).
